2	"1. **Veronica Juarez's Murder**: The case involves the murder of Veronica Juarez, whose severed head was found in a newspaper dispenser. The investigation leads to Elindio Zapata, who is interviewed by Det Sam Vega and Nick. Although Elindio denies direct involvement, his claims of being a descendant of Jesus Malverde, a figure revered by some as a protector or ""narco saint,"" and his admission that he may ""warn, protect, harm"" suggest he could be involved or have knowledge about the murder. The evidence, including a jacket with Veronica's blood and a suspicious item resembling a human finger, points towards his potential involvement."
