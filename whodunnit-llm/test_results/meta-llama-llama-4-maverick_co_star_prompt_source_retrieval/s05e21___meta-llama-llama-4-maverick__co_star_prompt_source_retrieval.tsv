1	"From the context, we can identify that Robbie Garson is the victim. The case summary can be ""Robbie Garson's murder"". "

1	Another potential case can be identified from the conversation between Grissom, Sara, and Valerie Dino. They discuss Adam Trent's background and his relationship with his mother. However, there is no clear indication of a crime committed by Adam Trent against Robbie Garson, but rather a potential motive or relation.

1	"If we consider Adam Trent as a potential perpetrator or a person of interest, the case summary remains ""Robbie Garson's murder"". "

2	Additionally, we can identify another potential case or a twist in the existing case. The conversation between Sara, Grissom, and Nurse Joanne McKay suggests that Nurse McKay might be involved with Adam Trent, and the lipstick on Adam's underwear is a crucial evidence.
