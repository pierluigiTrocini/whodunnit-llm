1,
1,The case summary is based on the events described. Although Adam Trent is not directly stated to be the perpetrator,several pieces of evidence and context suggest his involvement. The presence of Adam's semen in Robbie's bed indicates a sexual encounter between them,and Dr. Valerie Dino's analysis of Adam's psychological profile and behavior suggests that he is capable of deviating from his usual pattern if there's something tangible in return. The text does not provide a direct line of dialogue that supports the determination of Adam Trent as the perpetrator,hence 'no dialogue'.

Initially,Adam Trent confesses to the murder,but further investigation reveals inconsistencies in his confession and evidence pointing towards another perpetrator. The discovery of lipstick on Adam Trent's underwear,matching Nurse Joanne McKay's lipstick,and her defensive behavior when confronted about it,suggest that she is the perpetrator. The line of dialogue that supports this determination is Sara's statement to Joanne McKay about the lipstick on Adam's underwear.
